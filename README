This is a repository for state spending scrapers. It relies on the billy scraping framework used for the Open States project. It is currently dependent on the spending branch of billy. You can clone the branch here:

https://github.com/sunlightlabs/billy/tree/spending

After cloning the neanmachine repo and the billy repo, install the dependencies from both repos using 
pip install -r BILLY_REPO/requirements.txt
pip install -r NEANMACHINE_REPO/requirements.txt

Then cd into the billy directory and run

python setup.py develop

Now you should be able to run one of the existing scrapers (MD, VA or NY). CD into the top level of the neanmachine repo and run the command

billy-expenditures md

(for maryland, sub the abbreviation for whatever state you want to run)

To write your own scraper, you'll need to subclass the Billy scrapers in a file called either transactional_expenditures.py or aggregated_expenditures.py. You'll also need a short metadata file that defines the abbreviation for your state. Don't worry about database storage for now -- Billy will save the data to a raw JSON file for processing and importing later. 


Many state spending data varies in it's detail and granularity. If your data is aggregated by department/agency, object code, or other item, subclass the AggregatedTransactionalScraper. If you have line item transactional data, subclass the TransactionalExpenditureScraper. Both scrapers need a scrape method to be defined in the subclass. 
 

Set of possible (recommended) fields:

fiscal_year #required 
jurisdiction #required
scraper_type # possible values are transactional_expenditures, aggregated_expenditures
spending_type #possible values are salary, contract, grant, pension, general_expenditure
recipient_name
recipient_address
recipient_phone_number
recipient_city

recipient_state
description
category_code #sometimes called object code, budget code/function in source data
account_number
fund_number
fund_name
agency_name
agency_number
sub_agency_name # may need to be separated from top level agency name
sub_agency_number
amount  
transaction_description


Some states make their spending data available in CSV or other delimited forms. Our intern Nina (the namesake of this project) collected many of these datasets here:
http://datahub.io/en/group/us-state-spending-and-revenue-data

The datasets may need to be updated but source links should be available in the metadata of each dataset.
